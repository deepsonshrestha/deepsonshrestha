### Hi there 👋

I'm a technophile ,a die-hard gamer, and a total data nerd who's all about the exciting world of esports. I've got a degree in IT Engineering under my belt and currently find myself at <a target='blank' href = 'https://www.cloudfactory.com/'>CloudFactory</a>, where I get to geek out and immerse myself in the mind-blowing realm of data analytics. Stick around, and let's dive into some tech and gaming adventures together!

🧠 Geeked out about all things data-related, so expect to find a bunch of projects and repositories related to data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning.

🕹️ Gaming is my jam! You'll also stumble upon projects involving game analytics, esports data, and game development.

🌐 Oh, and there might even be some web development projects floating around. I dig crafting backend of web applications.
